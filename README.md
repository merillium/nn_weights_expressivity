# nn_weights_expressivity

This is a Dash App that helps visualize how a simple trajectory over a 2 layer shallow neural network can change with respect to the weights. This is mostly a fun visualization tool that I built out while reading the paper "On the Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks" where two of four the interesting claims made are that (2) there is exponential depth dependence that can be validated by measuring trajectory length and (3) lower weights matter more (and trajectory length should therefore be impacted more by changes to lower weights)
